###### TrackMate-Lacss

Goal to add [Lacss](https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss ) detector to the Trackmate-Cellpose Plugin


#### Installation

Lacss utilizes a deep-learning library named [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). JAX, while operational with only a CPU limits the computation power. GPUs (NVIDIA) or TPU are recommended especially with large datasets. 

### Nvidia GPUs 

Jax requires the prior installation of CUDA and CUDNN drivers for proper function. It is recommended to use ' Command Prompt ' followed by 'nivida-smi' to locate driver version and current CUDA driver version
